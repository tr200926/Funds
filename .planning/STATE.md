# Delivery State (bootstrap)

This repository still uses a bootstrap-style `STATE.md` because the canonical GSD format has not been re-established. Updates below are maintained manually.

## Current Plan Progress

- **Latest Phase:** 03-dashboard-mvp-nextjs
- **Latest Plan:** 02 (Overview Experience) – completed 2026-02-13. Overview route now fetches non-archived ad accounts with platform metadata, renders the realtime TanStack DataTable, and exposes platform/status/business manager filters plus days-to-depletion indicators.
- **Next Steps:** Continue Phase 03 with Plan 03 (Account detail + pipeline health) after verifying `/overview` in a Supabase-configured environment.

## Decisions Recorded

1. Continue using `npx supabase` because global installs are blocked by the upstream CLI.
2. Treat NUMERIC columns as strings inside generated TypeScript types to preserve financial precision.
3. Require the legacy migration script to run in dry-run mode by default so teams can validate transformations before writes.
4. Dual-write to legacy Facebook tables until operators observe seven discrepancy-free days, then disable the legacy writers.
5. Disable workflow-level retry-on-fail flags so the controller remains the single scheduler/error owner across all ingestion pipelines.
6. Run controller Execute Workflow calls sequentially with `continueOnFail` to limit Supabase load spikes and keep observability intact.
7. Treat any pipeline_run stuck in `running` for 30+ minutes as failed via the global error handler to keep dashboards accurate.
8. Keep the Next.js dashboard isolated inside `dashboard/` so pipeline tooling and dependencies in the repo root remain untouched.
9. Use Supabase's `getUser()` middleware refresh pattern (instead of deprecated helpers) to guarantee fresh JWTs during SSR.

## Issues / Blockers

- `gsd-tools state` automation still cannot parse this bootstrap `STATE.md`, so plan/phase counters must be updated manually until the canonical format is restored.
- Dashboard requires Supabase env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) from the user setup file before login/data paths can be exercised locally.

## Session Notes

- **Last Work Session:** Completed Phase 03 Plan 02 (Overview experience) on 2026-02-13; `/overview` now streams Supabase data into the realtime DataTable with filters, and commits `785a742` + `939da28` capture the server fetch and client interactions.
